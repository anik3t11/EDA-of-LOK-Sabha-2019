#    #### General elections were held in India in seven phases from 11 April to 19 May 2019 to elect the members of the 17th Lok Sabha. Votes were counted and the result declared on 23 May. Around 912 million people were eligible to vote, and voter turnout was over 67 percent â€“ the highest ever, as well as the highest ever participation by women voters.
# #### All 543 elected MPs are elected from single-member constituencies using first-past-the-post voting. The President of India appoints an additional two members from the Anglo-Indian community if he believes that community is under-represented.
# #### Eligible voters must be Indian citizens, 18 or older than 18, an ordinary resident of the polling area of the constituency and registered to vote (name included in the electoral rolls), possess a valid voter identification card issued by the Election Commission of India or an equivalent. Some people convicted of electoral or other offences are barred from voting.
# #### The elections are held on schedule and as per the Constitution of India that mandates parliamentary elections once every five years.
# #### In this analysis report we will analyze the LOK SABHA 2019 result. I have downloaded the election data set from kaggle with over 2,264 no. of rows and 19 column consisting of different parameter.
